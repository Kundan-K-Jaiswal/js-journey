# JS Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **JavaScript Journey** — a collection of topic-wise projects, experiments, and practice exercises I built while learning **JavaScript**.  
This repo showcases everything from the basics of variables and loops to more advanced concepts like promises, async/await, and APIs.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder represents a separate concept or project. Here's what's inside:

### 🔧 Core Topics & Projects

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `basics` | Covers variables, operators, and data types. |
| `functions` | Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions. |
| `loops` | For, while, do-while, and practical loop exercises. |
| `arrays` | Array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and practice examples. |
| `objects` | Creating, accessing, and manipulating objects. |
| `dom-practice` | Selecting, updating, and styling elements with JS. |
| `callback-hell` | Practice with nested callbacks and their challenges. |
| `promises` | Using JavaScript promises to handle asynchronous tasks. |
| `fetch-api` | Fetching and working with JSON data from APIs. |
| `async-await` | Cleaner asynchronous code using async/await. |
| `advanced` | Scope, closures, higher-order functions, and other advanced topics. |
