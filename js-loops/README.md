# âž¿Loops in JS


Here, in this folder I understood the concept of loops, how to and when to use loops. 
Loops are generally used to preform the repeated task again and again until the condition is false this makes our code short, well organized and easy to understand. 
There are 5 types of loops :
<li>for loop</li>
<li>for of ( used in arrays and strings )</li> 
<li>for in ( used in objects )</li>
<li>while</li>
<li>do while</li>
